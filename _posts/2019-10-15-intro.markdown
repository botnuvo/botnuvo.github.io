Robotics should be easier. Researchers, educators and developers need access to high
quality robot platforms. Most platforms available today are too expensive, poorly
supported and closed source - at Botnuvo, we've set out to change that. Today we are unveiling
our first product, a mobile robot designed for researchers, educators, and developers.
We think you're going to be very excited about Velocity.

Velocity has a powerful Intel-based PC inside, making it easy to run the latest and
greatest robotics code. All Velocity robots include a high quality and robust laser
range finder. Velocity uses highly efficient brushless hub motors for propulsion.

Velocity is designed with your lab space in mind. The robot platform weighs only 30
pounds (15kg), making it easy to move around from lab to lab or take on the road to
demonstrate your latest research. The robot is small and light enough to ship through
regular channels, avoiding the hassle and cost of freight deliveries.

Velocity supports the open source Robot Operating System (ROS). While ROS is now
available on a number of robot platforms, Velocity's ROS drivers will be entirely
open source!

Velocity is available in two configurations: Velocity and Velocity+. Our Velocity+ model
sports a longer-range laser and additional compute power, enabling operation
at higher speeds and in larger environments. The Velocity base model is designed
as a lower-cost option, primarily intended for classroom use. The full specifications
are posted on our <a href="/velocity">Velocity</a> page.

Later this month, we'll be exhibiting at
<a href="https://roscon.ros.org/2019/">ROScon</a> and
<a href="https://www.iros2019.org">IROS</a> in Macau, so stop by if you want to
see Velocity in person. Velocity will begin shipping at the end of this year - reach
out to us now if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on a Velocity.
