<h1>About Botnuvo</h1>

Robotics should be easier. Researchers, educators and developers need access to high
quality robot platforms. Most platforms available today are too expensive, poorly
supported and closed source - we've set out to change that. Our robot platforms build
upon and support open source projects. Research and Education are our core markets.<br><br>
